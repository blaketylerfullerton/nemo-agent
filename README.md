# Blake's Hackathon Version of the AIQ Toolkit

This is Blake‚Äôs experimental hackathon version of the AIQ toolkit. While documentation is limited due to time constraints, the core concept is simple: this project is a **lightweight background agent** inspired by tools like Cursor, but built using NVIDIA‚Äôs **NeMo Agent Toolkit**.

Think of it as a proof-of-concept for an AI-powered coding assistant that runs in the background, parsing intent and helping with code modifications. It‚Äôs minimal for now, and may feel **a bit slow or unoptimized**, but it lays the foundation for future development with more robust features and speed improvements.
